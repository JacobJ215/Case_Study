    Immersion Cooling: Bitfury’s data centers are powered by immersion cooling technology. This technology significantly reduces cooling costs while increasing the amount of computing density per rack supplied by each data center. 

    Exonum: As Bitfury’s premier blockchain, Exonum, was designed to help businesses and governments adapt blockchain technology as part of their ecosystem allowing these entities to begin building their own blockchain projects. 

    The Exonum platform is an industry leader in transaction processing speed, scalability, and project security. Similar to other programmable networks such as Ethereum, Exonum allows developers to build blockchain projects and platforms with smart contracts.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 

    I would suggest Bitfury to develop and release their own cryptocurrency. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    With the development of a currency by opening the network to the public an ICO would allow Bitfury to bring in additional revenue. Having its own coin, similar to the Celcius Network, BlockFi and the Lending Protocol AAVE,  Bitfuty could offer additional services such as borrowing, lending, staking and reward payments. Offering services such as these could dramatically increase Bitfury’s user base. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    This currency would be native to the exonum blockchain, and it should depend on more modern solutions such as proof of stake and sharding.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    Relative to other coins suchs as ADA, NEO, EOS, and XPR even with Layer2 scalling solutions Bitcoin is still slow, less cost efficient, and less energy efficient. Building its own cryptocurrency to run on Exonum could help tackle some of Bitcoin’s short fallings.
